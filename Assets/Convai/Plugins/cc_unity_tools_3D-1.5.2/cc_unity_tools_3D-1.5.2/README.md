# CC/iC Unity Tools 3D

Read Me
=======

Welcome to the [Unity](https://www.unity.com/) import and auto setup tool for **Character Creator 3**, **Character Creator 4**, **iClone 7** and **iClone 8** from [Reallusion](https://www.reallusion.com/).

This is a fully featured tool to take exports from CC/iClone and set them up in Unity with complete visual fidelity.

The tool can produce characters of the highest visual quality using custom Shadergraph shaders.
Additionally, more performance focussed characters can be produced using simpler shaders with a minimal loss of visual quality.

Progress and additional information can be found in the [Reallusion forum thread](https://forum.reallusion.com/488356/Unity-Auto-Setup).
